Objective: - Image Classification with CIFAR 100

This dataset is just like the CIFAR-10, except it has 100 classes containing 600
images each. There are 500 training images and 100 testing images per class.
The 100 classes in the CIFAR-100 are grouped into 20 superclasses. Each image
comes with a &quot;fine&quot; label (the class to which it belongs) and a &quot;coarse&quot; label
(the superclass to which it belongs).
